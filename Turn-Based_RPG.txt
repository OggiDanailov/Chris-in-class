Create a turn-based RPG. 
Phase 1: Set up a Hero and Enemy object. Each of them should have hit points and three abilities: Attack, Super Attack, and Defend. Attack and Defend should cancel each other out, doing no damage. Super Attack should do half damage to a Hero or Enemy who is defending. A Hero can choose which abilities to use through the console, and the Enemy should choose an ability in response to the Hero’s choice at random. 
Example: 

mainEnemy.hitPoints;
should return 10

mainHero.attack();

mainEnemy.hitPoints;
should return 5

Phase 2: Heroes and Enemies can have different Equipment. Weapons can cause different amounts of damage, while Armor can mitigate damage. Create some sort of maximum, such as weight, that prevents a hero or enemy from being able to equip the best Armor and Weapon at the same time. 

Phase 3: Create different types of Enemies that have different hitPoints and maximum equipment values. One type of enemy might have low armor and hit points but deal the most damage, while another might have high armor and hit points but lower damage.
Phase 4: Create status effects that can be applied to Heroes or Enemies, granted by certain equipment. Maybe a Dagger causes poison, which lowers HP by 2 per turn for five turns. Maybe wearing Frozen Armor makes it so an enemy cannot attack for a turn after attacking the hero. 
Phase 5: Set up many different Abilities, using all of the techniques that you’ve used so far: maximum ability points, mana/MP, status effects.
Phase 6: Build an interface that a user can use to play the game. They can see all their values, change equipment and abilities, and see how many and which enemies are attacking them. 
Phase 7: Make it so that multiple enemies and heroes can appear in a battle and can be targeted from the user interface. Create abilities (and weapons!) that affect multiple targets.
 Phase 8: Add in experience and levels that raise ability scores and HP/MP.
